// NOTES:
/*
1. access modifiers:
a. public
b. private
c. protected

2. class method is a function that process the data of the object

3. constructor: it is a special method which is invoked every time an object of class created,
    it we don't create it default constructor will run.
    It is used to initialize the data members of new objects generally.
    It constructs the values i.e. provides data for the object which is why it is known as constructors.
RULES:
-   It does not have return type
-   It has the same name as that of class
-   It is a public(may/maynot)

    when we create our own constructor we looses the default constructor created by compiler
    it also reduces the code

/4/four pillers of OOPS
1. incapsulation
2. abstraction
3. inheritance
4. polymorphism

/4.1/Encapsulation: we want to secure the data in class so that it cannot be accessed directly by other class.
        we want to provide the data with our own way.
        "It describes the idea of bundling data and methods that work on that data within one unit"
    getters and setters are the way to do encapsulation
    only the members of the particular class will be able to access the variables

/4.2/Abstraction: Hiding complex function thing behind the procedure to make things look simple
eg: smartphone take pics just press button(but the logic is complex)
    our side is user friendly
HIDING COMPLEXITY FROM USER

/4.3/Inheritance:
-   Inherited class or "DERIVED CLASS".
-   When another class(child class) inherit the properties of a base class then this process is
    is called inheritance
-   eg: THREe CLASES,

/4.4/Polymorphism
-   poly + morph => "many" + "forms"
-   ability of an object or a method having many form
-   parent class object is used to refer to a child class
-   //but d is developer and t is teacher so we can define work differently for both of them

In C++, polymorphism is mainly divided into two types:

1. COMPILE TIME POLYMORPHISM: 
    This type of polymorphism is achieved by function overloading or operator overloading.
    It can be achieved using 
    a. function overloading: same name function DIFFERENT PARMETERS
    function with 1 int parameter
    void func(int x)
    {
        cout << "value of x is " << x << endl;
    }
      
    function with same name but 1 double parameter
    void func(double x)
    {
        cout << "value of x is " << x << endl;
    }


    b. operator overloading:
        c++ provide this option also
        we can make use of the addition operator (+) for string class to concatenate two strings. We know that the task of this operator is to add two operands.
        Complex operator + (Complex const &obj) {
         Complex res;
         res.real = real + obj.real;
         res.imag = imag + obj.imag;
         return res;
    }






2. Runtime Polymorphism:
    This type of polymorphism is achieved by Function Overriding.
    Function overriding occurs when a derived class has a definition for one of the member functions of the base class. 
    That base function is said to be overridden. 


/5/SOME DEFINITIONS:::

A virtual function is a member function which is declared within a base class and is re-defined (overridden) by a derived class. 
When you refer to a derived class object using a pointer or a reference to the base class, 
you can call a virtual function for that object and execute the derived classâ€™s version of the function.
